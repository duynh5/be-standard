# Backend Engineering Key-Concept Refresher

Use this guide to restore the mental model behind a topic quickly. It is an
**after-learning review guide**, not the first explanation of these subjects. If a
term is unfamiliar, open the corresponding detailed lesson and work through its
concrete situation before returning here. This guide intentionally does not repeat
the deliverables or acceptance criteria. The
[overview and competency map](00-overview-and-competency-map.md) remains authoritative
for what to build and how completion is judged.

## How to use this refresher actively

Reading condensed bullets can create recognition without understanding. Use this
four-step loop for one topic at a time:

1. Read only the topic title and memory anchors.
2. Without looking, explain one concrete success and one concrete failure.
3. Answer the self-check questions in complete sentences.
4. Reopen the detailed lesson wherever your explanation becomes vague.

For example, do not merely repeat "timeouts are ambiguous." Construct the event
sequence:

```text
Ordering sends reserve-O-42.
Inventory commits it.
The response is lost.
Ordering reaches its timeout.
```

Then explain what the timeout proves, why a blind retry is unsafe, which stable
operation identity resolves the ambiguity, and how reconciliation discovers the
final state. If you cannot do that, the concept needs another learning pass rather
than more memorization.

## How the topics fit together

| Area | Focus | Question it answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain modeling | Domain understanding | What problem and rules are we actually implementing? |
| Production service | Service foundations | Can one service preserve data, fail safely, and be operated? |
| Distributed foundations | Asynchrony and distribution | Can work survive restarts, duplication, delay, and partitions? |
| Service extraction | Distributed delivery | Can independently deployed services remain compatible and diagnosable? |
| Scale and operations | Production growth | Can the system isolate tenants, run securely, and meet reliability goals? |
| Integration and leadership | System evolution | Can the system evolve safely and can its decisions be defended? |

The order matters. Distribution magnifies weak domain models, unsafe data handling, vague contracts, and poor observability. Build those foundations before adding independently deployed service boundaries.

Microservice thinking still starts during domain discovery. In every topic, use the [cross-cutting microservice lens](00-overview-and-competency-map.md#cross-cutting-microservice-lens) to ask what ownership is emerging, which assumptions would fail across a network, what contract and data access would become public, which operational costs would appear, and what evidence would justify extraction. Before the service-extraction chapter this is a counterfactual design exercise, not a reason to add speculative distributed infrastructure.

## Domain discovery and modeling

### Core ideas

- Requirements are hypotheses until examples expose their ambiguities. Turn statements such as "cancel an order" into concrete preconditions, transitions, outcomes, and rejected cases.
- A ubiquitous language gives each important term one agreed meaning across product discussion, code, APIs, events, and operations.
- Entities retain identity through change; value objects are interchangeable when their values match. Commands request change, while events name facts that already happened.
- Invariants are rules that must always hold. A state machine makes legal transitions, terminal states, and invalid actions explicit.
- A bounded context owns a coherent model and vocabulary. It is a reasoning boundary, not automatically a deployment boundary.

### Memory anchors

- Model business behavior before transport or storage.
- Examples reveal rules; invariants protect them; state machines expose gaps.
- Keep confirmed facts, assumptions, open questions, and deferred scope visibly separate.

### Self-check

- Can I explain why `Product` may mean different things in catalog and inventory contexts?
- Can I list every valid and invalid transition for an order without referring to HTTP or SQL?
- Which business rule must remain true during concurrent order placement?

## Decisions and executable skeleton

### Core ideas

- The composition root constructs concrete dependencies. Business packages should not discover configuration or initialize global infrastructure themselves.
- Parse configuration once into typed values, validate it at startup, and fail early with actionable errors.
- An architecture decision record captures context, options, the chosen tradeoff, and consequences. It preserves reasoning, not just the final choice.
- Graceful shutdown is a bounded protocol: stop accepting work, allow in-flight work to finish within a deadline, then release resources.
- Local and CI commands should exercise the same formatting, static analysis, tests, race checks, vulnerability checks, and build.

### Memory anchors

- A clean clone should have one reproducible path to a running service.
- Startup either establishes valid preconditions or fails loudly.
- Record why a decision was made so it can later be revisited intelligently.

### Self-check

- What owns dependency construction and process lifecycle?
- What happens from `SIGTERM` until process exit?
- Can every CI failure be reproduced locally with a documented command?

## HTTP platform

### Core ideas

- HTTP handlers translate between a public protocol and application operations. They should decode, validate transport concerns, call a use case, and map outcomes to stable responses.
- Enforce content type, body size, unknown-field rejection, and exactly one JSON value before untrusted input reaches business logic.
- Problem details give errors a stable machine-readable shape without exposing internal implementation details.
- Middleware order is behavior: request identity must exist before logging and recovery need it; authentication must run before authorization.
- Liveness answers "is the process alive?" Readiness answers "should this instance receive traffic?"
- Server, header, body, and shutdown limits keep slow or malicious clients from holding resources indefinitely.

### Memory anchors

- Validate the envelope at the edge and business rules in the use case.
- A panic becomes a generic response plus a correlated diagnostic record.
- Every request consumes bounded time and memory.

### Self-check

- Which malformed requests should be rejected before a use case runs?
- Why must liveness avoid checking the database?
- Where is an internal error translated into its public status and error code?

## Persistence foundation

### Core ideas

- A connection pool is a bounded concurrency resource. Its size, acquisition timeout, connection lifetime, and health affect the whole service.
- Database constraints are the final integrity barrier when application checks race or another writer bypasses the service.
- Parameterized queries keep data separate from executable SQL and prevent injection.
- Context cancellation must reach pool acquisition and query execution. Rows and transactions must be closed on every path.
- Migrations are ordered production changes. They must work from an empty database and account for existing data and mixed application versions.
- Integration tests use a real database because mocks cannot reproduce constraints, locks, isolation, query syntax, or driver behavior.

### Memory anchors

- Enforce critical invariants twice: expressive application rules and authoritative database constraints.
- Acquire late, release early, and bound the pool.
- Treat schema changes like code deployments.

### Self-check

- What protects uniqueness if two requests pass an application-level pre-check together?
- Which resources must be closed or rolled back after a failed query?
- Can the complete schema be reproduced from migrations alone?

## Product slice

### Core ideas

- A vertical slice keeps the transport, use case, persistence, and tests for one capability close while preserving inward dependency direction.
- Authentication establishes the principal. Authorization decides whether that principal may perform a specific action.
- Stable cursor pagination encodes the ordered position of the last result. Its ordering must be deterministic, commonly using a unique tie-breaker.
- Domain/application errors should have stable identity so the HTTP layer can map them without inspecting error text.
- Duplicate creation is a conflict only when the uniqueness rule is part of the public contract.

### Memory anchors

- Organize around capabilities, not global controller/service/repository buckets.
- A cursor is a position in a stable ordering, not a disguised page number.
- Keep unauthenticated and authenticated-but-forbidden outcomes distinct.

### Self-check

- What columns form a total order for product pagination?
- Where is admin authorization enforced and tested?
- How does a unique-constraint failure become a stable API conflict?

## Order transaction

### Core ideas

- A transaction boundary follows one business operation. Either the order, its items, and inventory reservation all commit, or none do.
- Concurrency correctness requires a database strategy such as an atomic conditional update, row lock, or appropriate isolation level. An earlier application read is not protection.
- Lock acquisition order should be deterministic to reduce deadlocks when an order touches multiple inventory rows.
- Object-level authorization belongs in the data access condition: select the order by both order ID and owner ID.
- Public errors reveal what clients need to act, not table names, SQL, or whether another user's object exists.

### Memory anchors

- Read-check-write is unsafe unless the database makes it one protected operation.
- Commit the business invariant, not individual repository calls.
- Scope the query, not just the response.

### Self-check

- How can two buyers contend for the last unit without producing negative stock?
- Which failures cause rollback, and who owns that rollback?
- Why should wrong-owner and nonexistent-order reads look the same externally?

## Idempotency and failure semantics

### Core ideas

- Idempotency lets repeated attempts for the same logical operation produce one effect. It is essential when a client cannot tell whether a timed-out request committed.
- The idempotency key identifies the attempt; a request fingerprint prevents that key from being reused for different input.
- Store the operation state and completed response within the same correctness boundary as the business effect, or explicitly handle the gap.
- Concurrent duplicates need serialization: one request performs the operation while others wait for or reuse its outcome.
- Retention must balance the client's retry window against storage growth. Expiry changes how old retries behave and is part of the contract.

### Memory anchors

- Same key plus same payload means same logical operation.
- Same key plus different payload is a conflict, not a retry.
- A disconnected client must be able to retry without guessing whether to create again.

### Self-check

- What exact data is fingerprinted, and is its encoding canonical?
- What happens if the process dies after the order commits but before the response is sent?
- When may an idempotency record be deleted safely?

## Observability and operational controls

### Core ideas

- Logs explain discrete events, metrics reveal aggregate trends, and traces connect work across boundaries. None substitutes completely for the others.
- Correlation identifiers and trace context let an operator follow a request without logging sensitive payloads.
- Useful service signals cover traffic, errors, latency distributions, and saturation. Audit events separately record security-relevant actions.
- Metric labels must have bounded cardinality. User IDs, order IDs, raw URLs, and error strings can make telemetry unusable or expensive.
- Alerts should identify actionable sustained user impact or imminent exhaustion, not every internal anomaly.
- A runbook joins symptoms to investigation, mitigation, rollback, and escalation.

### Memory anchors

- Instrument for questions an operator will need to answer under pressure.
- High-cardinality identifiers belong in traces or logs, not metric labels.
- Observability includes the action path, not just the detection signal.

### Self-check

- Can I reconstruct one failed request from its public error to the underlying dependency?
- Which labels are bounded, and which could grow without limit?
- What precise operator action follows each page?

## Deployment hardening

### Core ideas

- Build one immutable artifact and vary runtime configuration between environments. Rebuilding per environment destroys provenance.
- Containers should run as a non-root user, write only to explicit ephemeral locations, and expose the smallest practical attack surface.
- Readiness gates traffic; graceful shutdown drains it. Their timings must fit the platform's rollout and termination behavior.
- Expand-and-contract migrations allow old and new application versions to coexist: add compatible schema, migrate usage/data, then remove old schema later.
- A backup is only a possibility; a successful restore drill is evidence.
- Resource requests and limits turn accidental unbounded use into explicit operational behavior.

### Memory anchors

- Artifact promotion, runtime configuration, and verified provenance belong together.
- Deploy application and schema changes for mixed-version operation.
- Recovery claims require restores, not checkboxes.

### Self-check

- Can the old version run safely after the new migration is applied?
- What happens to an in-flight request when the platform terminates a container?
- When was the last restore tested and what was verified afterward?

## Performance and resilience based on evidence

### Core ideas

- Throughput is completed work per time; latency is a distribution, not an average. Utilization and saturation show how close a bounded resource is to its limit.
- Queueing causes latency to rise sharply near capacity. Load generation must avoid coordinated omission, which hides delays by slowing request issuance when the system slows.
- Profile the limiting workload before optimizing. CPU, heap, allocations, goroutines, mutex contention, blocking, query plans, and dependency time answer different questions.
- Representative data shape, traffic mix, concurrency, warmup, and environment are part of a performance result.
- Overload controls reject or shed excess work early so accepted work can still complete.
- Caching adds invalidation and consistency costs; introduce it only after evidence identifies repeated expensive reads.

### Memory anchors

- Measure, locate the bottleneck, change one thing, measure again.
- Tail latency and saturation usually matter more than averages.
- Predictable rejection is safer than global exhaustion.

### Self-check

- What workload assumptions support the latency target?
- Which profile proves the suspected bottleneck?
- How does the service behave just beyond capacity?

## Advanced PostgreSQL operations and recovery

### Core ideas

- MVCC gives transactions snapshots while retaining old row versions. Isolation level determines which anomalies are prevented and what may block or abort.
- Deadlocks arise from cyclic waits; PostgreSQL aborts one participant. Consistent lock order prevents many deadlocks, while safe whole-operation retries handle expected transient aborts.
- Vacuum, statistics, bloat, checkpoints, and WAL affect query planning, storage reuse, write latency, replication, and recovery.
- Large migrations should be lock-aware, batched, resumable, observable, and verifiable. A transaction around everything is not automatically safer.
- Base backups plus continuous WAL archiving enable point-in-time recovery. Replication and standby promotion primarily address availability, not accidental deletion by themselves.
- RPO measures tolerable data loss; RTO measures tolerable recovery time. Both must be proven by drills.

### Memory anchors

- Isolation is a chosen anomaly/availability tradeoff, not a generic "safe" switch.
- Retry only the entire operation and only when repeating its effects is safe.
- Backup, restore, replication, and failover solve different problems.

### Self-check

- Which anomaly can occur at the selected isolation level?
- How does an interrupted backfill resume without skipping or duplicating work?
- What measured evidence supports the stated RPO and RTO?

## Durable background jobs and scheduling

### Core ideas

- A goroutine disappears with its process. Durable jobs persist intent outside the worker and survive crashes and deployments.
- Most queues provide at-least-once execution: a job can run more than once, especially if a worker finishes the side effect but dies before acknowledgement.
- A visibility lease temporarily grants work. Expired work becomes available again, so handlers must be idempotent.
- Retry only transient failures, use bounded exponential backoff with jitter, and quarantine poison jobs after a documented attempt limit.
- Backpressure and bounded worker concurrency prevent the job system from overwhelming its dependencies.
- Schedulers must assume multiple replicas may trigger the same period. Make the scheduled action idempotent or coordinate it safely.

### Memory anchors

- Persist intent, lease work, make effects idempotent, then acknowledge.
- Queue age shows user delay better than queue length alone.
- Shutdown stops intake before finishing or safely releasing leased work.

### Self-check

- What happens if a worker dies after sending an email but before acknowledging the job?
- Which errors retry, which fail permanently, and which go to quarantine?
- Can two scheduler replicas trigger the cleanup safely?

## Reliable event publication and consumption

### Core ideas

- A database transaction cannot normally commit atomically with a broker publish. The transactional outbox commits domain state and publication intent together.
- A relay repeatedly publishes unpublished outbox entries. It must tolerate publishing successfully and crashing before recording success.
- Consumers assume duplicate delivery. An inbox or deduplication record must commit atomically with the consumer's state change when duplicate effects would be unsafe.
- Ordering exists only within a defined scope, often a partition key. Global ordering is expensive and usually unnecessary.
- Event contracts need ownership, semantic meaning, compatibility rules, version strategy, retention, and replay expectations.
- "Exactly once" always has a boundary; external side effects still require idempotency or reconciliation.

### Memory anchors

- Outbox prevents lost publication; inbox prevents unsafe repeated consumption.
- Publish facts in past tense, with enough identity to deduplicate and correlate.
- Design replay before relying on it for recovery.

### Self-check

- What happens if the relay crashes immediately after the broker accepts an event?
- Which key defines ordering for `OrderPlaced` events?
- Can replay rebuild the same final state without repeating an external side effect?

## Distributed-systems mechanics lab

### Core ideas

- Distributed failure is partial: one direction, node, or message can fail while everything else appears healthy.
- Wall clocks can jump and disagree. Use monotonic time for elapsed durations and avoid inferring a total event order from timestamps alone.
- Quorum choices trade availability, consistency, and latency under partitions; the useful answer depends on the operation and failure model.
- A lease says an owner may act for a time, but a paused old owner can resume after expiry. A monotonically increasing fencing token lets the protected resource reject stale owners.
- Consensus establishes a replicated order despite failures. Application teams should use maintained implementations rather than inventing their own.
- Deterministic simulation makes delay, loss, duplication, and reordering reproducible without fragile sleeps.

### Memory anchors

- Timeouts create uncertainty; they do not prove the remote operation failed.
- Leases need fencing when stale owners can still reach the resource.
- Consistent hashing limits key movement; it does not provide consistency.

### Self-check

- Which operations remain available during a partition, and what can they return?
- How does a protected resource recognize a stale lease holder?
- What reconciliation rule runs after partition healing?

## Service-boundary discovery and first extraction

### Core ideas

- A service boundary should align with a business capability, data ownership, and team responsibility, not a table or technical layer.
- A distributed monolith has separate deployments but retains tight coordination, shared data, or lockstep releases, giving cost without autonomy.
- The owning service is the only writer and contract authority for its data. Cross-service table reads bypass that authority.
- Extraction adds network latency, partial failure, compatibility work, telemetry, deployment pipelines, security boundaries, and on-call burden.
- Branch by abstraction introduces a stable interface, runs old and new implementations during migration, and shifts traffic incrementally.

### Memory anchors

- Extract to gain measurable autonomy or isolation, not to obtain a fashionable topology.
- Data ownership is stricter than "different schemas in the same database."
- Prefer a low-risk asynchronous capability for the first extraction.

### Self-check

- What evidence shows this module changes or scales independently?
- Can the extracted service fail without blocking order placement?
- Which operational costs increased after the split?

## Synchronous service communication and the system edge

### Core ideas

- Choose HTTP/JSON or gRPC from client compatibility, tooling, contract, streaming, and latency needs, not slogans.
- A caller owns an end-to-end deadline budget. Connection, retries, and downstream processing must fit within the remaining time.
- Retries multiply across layers. Select one intentional layer, bound attempts, add backoff and jitter, and retry only idempotent or protected operations.
- Circuit breakers limit repeated calls to a failing dependency; bulkheads limit shared-resource damage; load shedding rejects excess work; fallbacks must be semantically honest.
- Gateways centralize edge concerns such as authentication, TLS, routing, and coarse rate limits. Business authorization stays with the service that owns the rule.
- Connection pools and concurrency limits must be bounded per dependency.

### Memory anchors

- Propagate cancellation and spend one finite deadline budget.
- A retry is extra load during failure; earn it with idempotency and a clear benefit.
- Bound waiting, attempts, connections, and concurrency.

### Self-check

- Can any outbound call outlive its parent request?
- Which single layer retries, and how is retry multiplication prevented?
- What response does the caller receive when inventory is unavailable?

## Distributed workflows and eventual consistency

### Core ideas

- Independently owned databases cannot share an ordinary local ACID transaction. Intermediate states are therefore part of the domain model.
- A saga is a durable sequence of local transactions. Orchestration centralizes progression; choreography reacts to events and can become harder to understand as interactions grow.
- Compensation is a new business action, not time travel. It can fail and must be idempotent, observable, and sometimes manual.
- Durable workflow state records current step, attempts, deadlines, correlation, and the decisions needed to resume after a crash.
- Delayed, duplicate, and out-of-order messages are normal inputs. Transition guards must make their handling explicit.
- Operators need safe commands to inspect, retry, compensate, or mark resolved without editing tables by hand.

### Memory anchors

- Model temporary inconsistency explicitly and bound how long it may last.
- Every step and compensation must survive repetition.
- A workflow is incomplete until stuck-state detection and repair exist.

### Self-check

- What valid state follows failure at each transition?
- What happens when confirmation arrives after cancellation?
- Which repair actions require human judgment and an audit trail?

## Contract evolution and independent delivery

### Core ideas

- Independent deployment means provider and consumer versions can coexist inside a documented compatibility window.
- Compatibility is semantic as well as structural. Changing defaults, validation, ordering, timing, or error meaning can break a consumer without changing schema shape.
- Additive fields are generally safer when readers ignore unknown data and writers do not make new data immediately mandatory.
- Consumer-driven contract tests express behavior real consumers depend on; provider verification checks those expectations against the provider build.
- Contract tests complement integration and end-to-end tests because they do not prove infrastructure, configuration, or whole workflows.
- Deprecation needs an owner, usage telemetry, notice, migration path, deadline, and evidence before removal.

### Memory anchors

- Design changes for mixed versions and both deployment orders.
- Schemas describe shape; tests and prose must capture semantics.
- Removal is a measured migration, not a date on a calendar.

### Self-check

- Can the consumer deploy before the provider and vice versa?
- Which seemingly additive change could still alter existing behavior?
- What evidence proves a deprecated contract has no remaining callers?

## Distributed observability and resilience validation

### Core ideas

- Trace context must propagate through HTTP/RPC calls, event metadata, and background jobs so one logical operation remains connected.
- Baggage propagates broadly and can leak or amplify sensitive/high-cardinality data; keep it minimal and safe.
- Distributed systems create emergent failures: retry storms, synchronized recovery, fan-out amplification, and backlog growth may not appear in component tests.
- Tail-aware or error-biased sampling preserves diagnostically valuable slow and failed traces while controlling cost.
- A chaos experiment needs a hypothesis, bounded blast radius, abort condition, observation plan, and proof of recovery.
- Symptom-based runbooks start from what users see and guide the operator to the first failing dependency.

### Memory anchors

- Correlate the whole workflow, including asynchronous gaps.
- Inject faults to test a specific claim, not to create random drama.
- Recovery behavior is part of the experiment result.

### Self-check

- Can one order be traced through API, broker, worker, and downstream services?
- Which telemetry distinguishes an originating failure from cascading symptoms?
- What automatically stops a fault experiment if impact exceeds its boundary?

## Data scaling, caching, and multi-tenancy

### Core ideas

- Cache-aside reads from cache first, loads from the source of truth on a miss, then populates the cache. TTL, invalidation, stampede protection, bypass, and failure behavior define its consistency.
- Read replicas reduce primary read load but introduce lag. Route only operations whose staleness and read-after-write behavior are acceptable.
- Partitioning limits the amount of data each operation scans or maintains; archival moves old data; retention deletes data. They solve different growth problems.
- Tenant isolation spans identity, queries, jobs, events, caches, quotas, encryption, telemetry, and operator tools, not just a `tenant_id` column.
- Shared-table, schema-per-tenant, and database-per-tenant designs trade density, isolation, operational effort, and customization.
- Search and analytics are derived views that require replay, rebuild, and reconciliation with an authoritative source.

### Memory anchors

- The source of truth must remain correct when every cache is empty or stale.
- Propagate tenant identity across every synchronous and asynchronous boundary.
- Scale from measured pressure, with rollback and reconciliation.

### Self-check

- What read-after-write behavior does a user receive?
- Can a tenant identifier be omitted or forged in any worker, cache key, or query?
- How is a corrupted search index rebuilt completely?

## Security, privacy, and software supply chain

### Core ideas

- Threat modeling follows data and trust boundaries: identify assets, actors, entry points, abuse cases, mitigations, and residual risk.
- User identity represents an end user; workload identity authenticates a service or job. Do not grant a service every privilege any user might need.
- Mutual authentication, encryption in transit, short-lived credentials, least privilege, and rotation reduce lateral movement and credential lifetime.
- Privacy engineering inventories personal data by purpose, owner, location, retention, access, export, and deletion behavior.
- Backups and immutable event logs may require policy-based expiry or cryptographic erasure rather than immediate physical deletion; document the limitation honestly.
- An SBOM records components; provenance and signatures connect source, build, and artifact; vulnerability response turns detection into a verified deployment.

### Memory anchors

- Every new service, queue, datastore, and admin endpoint is a trust boundary.
- Collect less, retain less, grant less, and rotate safely.
- Supply-chain controls must verify what is deployed, not merely scan source code.

### Self-check

- What can a stolen workload credential access, and for how long?
- Where does each sensitive field flow and when is it deleted?
- Can a vulnerable artifact be identified, rebuilt, verified, and replaced quickly?

## Cloud infrastructure and IAM

### Core ideas

- Accounts/projects are administrative boundaries; regions and availability zones are failure and latency boundaries. Design assumptions must match the provider's actual guarantees.
- Routes determine possible paths; firewalls/security groups restrict allowed paths; NAT enables controlled outbound access; private endpoints avoid public transit to managed services.
- DNS, certificates, TLS termination, load balancers, and health checks form a layered edge whose failures must be distinguishable.
- Human and workload access should use federated or short-lived identity, narrowly scoped roles, and audited elevation, not shared static credentials.
- Managed services transfer infrastructure work but applications still own schema, access policy, capacity choices, failure handling, and recovery validation.
- Infrastructure as code requires protected state, review, policy checks, drift detection, ownership labels, budget controls, and precisely scoped teardown.

### Memory anchors

- Default-deny connectivity and least-privilege identity reduce the reachable blast radius.
- Reproducibility means no required console-only steps.
- Teardown is a dangerous production operation and must resolve exact ownership boundaries.

### Self-check

- Can the database or an admin endpoint be reached from the public internet?
- Which exact resources can each workload identity access?
- Can the environment be recreated and safely removed from version-controlled definitions?

## Orchestration and platform operations

### Core ideas

- An orchestrator continuously reconciles desired and observed state. It restarts processes but cannot repair incorrect application state or unsafe retry behavior.
- Resource requests guide scheduling; limits cap use; autoscaling reacts to signals; disruption budgets and rollout settings constrain simultaneous unavailability.
- Startup means initialization is complete, readiness means traffic is safe, and liveness means restart may help. Confusing them causes restart loops or premature traffic.
- Services, ingress, configuration, secret references, network policies, and volumes are explicit platform contracts.
- Autoscaling on a poor signal can amplify overload downstream. Scale from a bottleneck-relevant signal and respect database or broker capacity.
- Platform abstractions should provide safe defaults while preserving visibility into failures and generated resources.

### Memory anchors

- Reconciliation restores declared process state, not business correctness.
- Probe semantics affect rollouts and recovery directly.
- Scale the system bottleneck, not merely the frontmost workload.

### Self-check

- What happens during node loss, failed readiness, and termination?
- Can a rollout preserve capacity while old and new contracts coexist?
- Which signal scales workers without overwhelming their dependency?

## Reliability engineering, incidents, and cost

### Core ideas

- An SLI is a measured aspect of user experience; an SLO is its target over a window. The error budget is the allowed unreliability within that target.
- Good paging alerts indicate actionable user impact or imminent exhaustion and balance detection speed against false alarms.
- Capacity planning relates expected demand to resource saturation, dependency ceilings, headroom, growth, and recovery needs.
- Incident response separates coordination, investigation, communication, and mitigation roles so urgent work stays coherent.
- A blameless review explains contributing system conditions, evidence, response quality, and corrective actions without reducing the cause to one person's mistake.
- Cost includes infrastructure, engineering time, operational complexity, and lost opportunities. A cheaper resource can create a more expensive system.

### Memory anchors

- Reliability targets begin with the user's successful operation.
- Error budgets make the reliability-versus-delivery tradeoff explicit.
- Corrective actions need owners, deadlines, verification, and evidence of completion.

### Self-check

- Does the SLI measure user success or an internal proxy?
- What is the first saturated dependency at forecast traffic plus headroom?
- Could an on-call engineer act on every page without additional context?

## Common production integration boundaries

### Core ideas

- Third-party calls need narrow adapters, explicit timeouts, quotas, retry policy, stable internal errors, fakes, sandbox tests, and operational visibility.
- A timeout is ambiguous: the provider may have completed the request. Use provider idempotency keys, status lookup, or reconciliation before repeating effects.
- Webhook receivers verify a signature over the exact raw payload, enforce a timestamp/replay window, deduplicate deliveries, and acknowledge according to a documented retry contract.
- Large object transfers should stream directly to object storage with authorization, size/type limits, checksums, lifecycle, and asynchronous scanning or processing.
- Email/notification success is asynchronous; bounces, complaints, suppressions, preferences, and provider callbacks change later state.
- Every derived read model needs a complete rebuild and reconciliation path from authoritative data or events.

### Memory anchors

- Treat external systems as slow, quota-bound, fallible, and semantically ambiguous.
- Authenticate and deduplicate webhooks before applying effects.
- Stream large data; never buffer it without a strict bound.

### Self-check

- What happens if a provider times out after accepting a write?
- How are forged, replayed, duplicated, and reordered webhooks handled?
- Can a derived view be deleted and rebuilt without losing authoritative data?

## Maintenance and legacy-system evolution

### Core ideas

- Actual behavior is discovered from code, tests, telemetry, stored data, documentation, and user dependence. Documentation alone may describe intended rather than current behavior.
- Characterization tests pin important existing behavior before refactoring or changing poorly specified code.
- Feature flags, canaries, shadow traffic, and compatibility windows make change observable and reversible, but temporary mechanisms become debt if not removed.
- Upgrades require release-note review, compatibility tests, staged rollout, and a rollback or roll-forward plan specific to the changed layer.
- Data repair is production code: constrain scope, support dry run and resume, make it idempotent, record an audit trail, and verify results independently.
- Refactoring preserves public behavior; migration deliberately changes behavior through compatible steps.

### Memory anchors

- First learn what the system does, then protect it, then change it.
- Reversibility is designed before rollout.
- Delete flags, compatibility branches, and obsolete dependencies when the migration is proven complete.

### Self-check

- Which evidence defines the legacy behavior that must be preserved?
- Can the rollout be stopped or reversed after partial exposure?
- How does a repair command prove it cannot cross its declared scope?

## Capstone delivery and engineering leadership

### Core ideas

- Engineering leadership connects a user problem to requirements, alternatives, tradeoffs, implementation, tests, telemetry, rollout, operations, and cost.
- A design document makes assumptions and decisions reviewable before implementation expense hardens them. It should include rejected alternatives and consequences.
- Critical review is part of the work. Record what changed because of feedback and why any unresolved risk is accepted.
- Small compatible changes reduce review size, isolate risk, and allow evidence to influence later steps.
- Operational ownership includes migration, staged rollout, dashboards, failure drills, recovery rehearsal, and a handoff another engineer can use.
- Simplicity is an active design criterion: be able to name what could be removed if the requirements shrink.

### Memory anchors

- Claims should be traceable from requirement to code, test, telemetry, and runbook.
- Deliver evidence, not confidence statements.
- Ownership includes reviewing others and teaching the system clearly.

### Self-check

- Can each requirement be traced to implementation and production-like evidence?
- Which failure, concurrency, restart, duplicate, and mixed-version cases matter for this design?
- What complexity would I remove first if the problem became simpler?

## Cross-topic recall checklist

Before calling any topic complete, be able to answer these questions:

- **Contract:** What inputs, outputs, errors, compatibility promises, and ownership boundaries are public?
- **Data:** Which invariants are authoritative, where are they enforced, and what happens under concurrency?
- **Time:** Which deadlines, leases, retention periods, retry windows, and clock assumptions exist?
- **Resources:** Which pools, queues, payloads, retries, workers, and cardinalities are bounded?
- **Failure:** What can fail partially, what becomes ambiguous, and how does the system converge or get repaired?
- **Distribution:** Which local assumptions would break across a service boundary, and what evidence justifies paying that cost now?
- **Security:** Who or what is the principal, what may it access, and how small is credential exposure?
- **Observability:** Can an operator detect, diagnose, mitigate, and verify recovery without inspecting private data?
- **Delivery:** Can old and new versions coexist, and is rollback or roll-forward tested?
- **Evidence:** Which deterministic test, measurement, drill, or review supports each important claim?
- **Simplicity:** Which complexity is essential now, and which can be deferred or removed?
