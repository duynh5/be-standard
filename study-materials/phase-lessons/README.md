# Detailed Implementation Phase Lessons

These guides expand Phases 0-26 of the
[backend learning roadmap](../../BACKEND_LEARNING_ROADMAP.md). They are project-based
lessons for a learner who has completed the seven-day foundation or already
understands its Go, HTTP, PostgreSQL, testing, and operational concepts. External
references are optional for deeper study. The roadmap remains authoritative for
phase order, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.

Complete phases sequentially. Within each phase, study the mental model, perform the
guided work, run the failure checks, answer the knowledge check, and collect the
completion evidence before advancing.

## How to learn from a phase

Each phase changes one running system. Before writing code, restate four things in
plain language:

1. What user or operator problem exists now?
2. Why does the previous phase's design not solve it?
3. Which new guarantee will this phase add?
4. Which test, measurement, or drill will prove that guarantee?

Then work in one small vertical increment at a time. For example, do not implement
an entire background-job platform before observing one durable job survive one
worker restart. Build the smallest path, make its failure visible, and generalize
only after the behavior is understood.

The **Goal and mental model** explains the problem. **Guided work** is the build
sequence. **Failure checks** deliberately challenge the design. **Completion
evidence** is the proof you keep. If a phase reads like unexplained shorthand,
return to its prerequisite daily lesson or earlier phase instead of memorizing the
terms.
